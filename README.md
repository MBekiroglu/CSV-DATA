Sprint 1: Understanding the project requirements (15 mins)

Sprint 2: Create test cases for File.class and Employee.class (1 hour)

Reflection - Understood the project requirements therefore moved on to implementing the project.
Review - We managed to create the classes, constructors and a method. 

Jack - Write tests for read() method within File.class
Thanu - In SQL Revision Workshop
Mehmet - Write tests for Employee object creation

Sprint 3: Researched about what collections to use. (30 mins)
Reflection - We should have set smaller tasks instead of giving the tasks of creating the classes as a whole.
Review-  We done our research and we came to conclusion that we are using hashmap.

Jack, Thanu & Mehmet: Researched came up with different ideas on how to make use of the collection framework in the project.


Sprint 4: Creating the employee object from the data read and implimenting the method for corrupted data. (40 minutes)
Reflection- We spent most of the time on the local date, due to the date formatter.
Review- Created an if statement that checks for the correct title of the employee and the gender. 
        In file class tried to create employee object.

Thanu & Mehmet- Created an if statement that checks for the correct title of the employee and the gender with test-cases 


Sprint 5: Analysed the CSV file.  (1 hour)

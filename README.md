Sprint 1: 


Sprint 5: Testing add() method (20 mins)

 

Reflection - Previous sprint took too long. Objectives were not clear and caused confusion.
Review - sprint shorted to 20mins. SMART targets used to identify each person's goals

 

Astha - write tests for add() method. 
Manish - Finish algorithm for add method with speed test

 

Tests to be run against smallest sample size
```
